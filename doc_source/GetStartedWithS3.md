# Getting started with Amazon S3<a name="GetStartedWithS3"></a>

You can get started with Amazon S3 by working with buckets and objects\. A *bucket* is a container for objects\. An *object* is a file and any metadata that describes that file\.

To store an object in Amazon S3, you create a bucket and then upload the object to the bucket\. When the object is in the bucket, you can open it, download it, and move it\. When you no longer need an object or a bucket, you can clean up your resources\.

With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use\. For more information about Amazon S3 features and pricing, see [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3)\. If you are a new Amazon S3 customer, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free\. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free)\.
