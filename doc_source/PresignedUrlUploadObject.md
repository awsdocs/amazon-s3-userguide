# Generating a presigned URL to upload an object<a name="PresignedUrlUploadObject"></a>

A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the presigned URL has permissions to access that object\. That is, if you receive a presigned URL to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the presigned URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object\. 

All objects and buckets by default are private\. The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions\. 

When you create a presigned URL, you must provide your security credentials and then specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method \(PUT for uploading objects\), and an expiration date and time\. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration\. That is, you must start the action before the expiration date and time\. 

If the action consists of multiple steps, such as a multipart upload, all steps must be started before the expiration\. Otherwise, you will receive an error when Amazon S3 tries to start a step with an expired URL\.

You can use the presigned URL multiple times, up to the expiration date and time\.

**Access to presigned URLs**  
Because presigned URLs grant access to your Amazon S3 buckets to whoever has the URL, we recommend that you protect them appropriately\. For more information about protecting presigned URLs, see [Limiting presigned URL capabilities](using-presigned-url.md#PresignedUrlUploadObject-LimitCapabilities)\.

Anyone with valid security credentials can create a presigned URL\. However, for you to successfully upload an object, the presigned URL must be created by someone who has permission to perform the operation that the presigned URL is based upon\. For more information, see [Who can create a presigned URL](using-presigned-url.md#who-presigned-url)\.

## Generating a presigned URL for uploading objects<a name="generating-presigned-url"></a>

You can generate a presigned URL programmatically using the AWS SDKs for \.NET, Java, Ruby, [JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property), PHP, and [Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.generate_presigned_url)\.

You can use the AWS SDK to generate a presigned URL that you or anyone that you give the URL to can use to upload an object to Amazon S3\. When you use the URL to upload an object, Amazon S3 creates the object in the specified bucket\. If an object with the same key that is specified in the presigned URL already exists in the bucket, Amazon S3 replaces the existing object with the uploaded object\.

### Using AWS Explorer for Visual Studio<a name="upload-object-presignedurl-vsexplorer"></a>

If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can generate a presigned object URL without writing any code by using AWS Explorer in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\. Anyone who receives a valid presigned URL can then programmatically upload an object\. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 from AWS Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/tkv-s3.html) in the *AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio User Guide*\. 

For instructions on installing AWS Explorer, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs, and explorers](UsingAWSSDK.md)\.

### Using the AWS SDKs<a name="presigned-urls-upload-examples"></a>

The following examples show how to upload objects using presigned URLs\.

The following code examples show how to create a presigned URL for S3 and upload an object\.

```
	// Get a presigned URL for the object.
	// In order to get a presigned URL for an object, you must
	// create a Presignclient
	fmt.Println("Create Presign client")

	presignParams := &s3.GetObjectInput{
		Bucket: aws.String(name),
		Key:    aws.String("path/myfile.jpg"),
	}

	// Apply an expiration via an option function
	presignDuration := func(po *s3.PresignOptions) {
		po.Expires = 5 * time.Minute
	}

	presignResult, err := presignClient.PresignGetObject(context.TODO(), presignParams, presignDuration)
