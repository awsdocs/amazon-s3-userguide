# Sharing objects using presigned URLs<a name="ShareObjectPreSignedURL"></a>

By default, all S3 objects are private\. Only the object owner has permission to access them\. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time\-limited permission to download the objects\. 

When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials and then specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method \(GET to download the object\), and an expiration date and time\. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration\. If you created a presigned URL using a temporary token, then the URL expires when the token expires, even if the URL was created with a later expiration time\. 

Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object\. For example, if you have a video in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private, you can share the video with others by generating a presigned URL\. Because presigned URLs grant access to your Amazon S3 buckets to whoever has the URL, we recommend that you protect them appropriately\. For more details about protecting presigned URLs, see [Limiting presigned URL capabilities](using-presigned-url.md#PresignedUrlUploadObject-LimitCapabilities)\.

For more information about who can create a presigned URL, see [Who can create a presigned URL](using-presigned-url.md#who-presigned-url)\.

## Generating a presigned URL to share an object<a name="generating-presigned-url"></a>

You can generate a presigned URL for an object without writing any code by using the S3 console or AWS Explorer for Visual Studio\. You can also generate a presigned URL programmatically using the AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, [Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Presigner.html), [PHP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.S3.S3Client.html#_createPresignedRequest), [Node\.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property), [Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.generate_presigned_url), and [Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/s3-example-presigned-urls.html)\.

**Note**  
When you generate a presigned URL, make sure that the parameters in your request match the signature exactly\. For example, if you don't specify a content type when generating the URL, you must omit the content type when uploading an object\. Also, wildcards are not supported, and using one in your presigned URL will result in an error\.

### Using the S3 console<a name="ShareObjectPreSignedURLConsole"></a>

 You can use the AWS Management Console to generate a presigned URL for an object by following these steps\. 

**Note**  
In the Amazon S3 console, the maximum expiration time for a presigned URL is 12 hours from the time of creation\. 

**To generate a presigned URL using the AWS Management Console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the object that you want a presigned URL for\.

1. In the **Objects** list, select the object that you want to create a presigned URL for\.

1. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Share with a presigned URL**\.

1. Specify how long you want the presigned URL to be valid\.

1. Choose **Create presigned URL**\.

1. When a confirmation appears, the URL is automatically copied to your clipboard\. You will see a button to copy the presigned URL if you need to copy it again\.

### Using AWS Explorer for Visual Studio<a name="ShareObjectPreSignedURLVSExplorer"></a>

If you are using Visual Studio, you can generate a presigned URL for an object without writing any code by using AWS Explorer for Visual Studio\. Anyone with this URL can download the object\. For more information, go to [Using Amazon S3 from AWS Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitVS/latest/UserGuide/using-s3.html)\. 

**Note**  
With AWS Explorer for Visual Studio, the maximum expiration time for a presigned URL is 7 days from the time of creation\. 

For instructions on how to install the AWS Explorer, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs, and explorers](UsingAWSSDK.md)\.

### Using the AWS SDKs<a name="ShareObjectPreSignedURLSDK"></a>

The following examples generate a presigned URL that you can give to others so that they can retrieve an object\. 

**Note**  
With the AWS SDKs, the maximum expiration time for a presigned URL is 7 days from the time of creation\.

#### [ Python ]

Generate a presigned URL to share an object by using the SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\. For example, use a Boto3 client and the `generate_presigned_url` function to generate a presigned URL that GETs an object\.

```
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
    ClientMethod='get_object', 
    Params={
        'Bucket': 'BUCKET_NAME',
        'Key': 'OBJECT_KEY'
    },
    ExpiresIn=3600
)
```

For more information about using SDK for Python \(Boto3\) to generate a presigned URL, see [Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.generate_presigned_url) in the *AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\) API Reference*\.

### Using the AWS CLI<a name="ShareObjectPresignedCLI"></a>

To generate a presigned URL to share an object using the AWS CLI, see [presign](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/presign.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

**Note**  
With the AWS CLI, the maximum expiration time for a presigned URL is 7 days from the time of creation\.
