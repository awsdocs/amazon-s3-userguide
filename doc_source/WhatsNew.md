|  IAM enables cross\-account delegation   |  Previously, to access an Amazon S3 resource, an IAM user needed permissions from both the parent AWS account and the Amazon S3 resource owner\. With cross\-account access, the IAM user now only needs permission from the owner account\. That is, If a resource owner grants access to an AWS account, the AWS account can now grant its IAM users access to these resources\.  For more information, see [Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  For more information on specifying principals in a bucket policy, see [Principals](s3-bucket-user-policy-specifying-principal-intro.md)\.  | June 6, 2011 | 
|  New link  |  This service's endpoint information is now located in the AWS General Reference\. For more information, go to Regions and Endpoints in [AWS General Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)\.  | March 1, 2011 | 
|  Support for hosting static websites in Amazon S3  |  Amazon S3 introduces enhanced support for hosting static websites\. This includes support for index documents and custom error documents\. When using these features, requests to the root of your bucket or a subfolder \(for example, `http://mywebsite.com/subfolder`\) returns your index document instead of the list of objects in your bucket\. If an error is encountered, Amazon S3 returns your custom error message instead of an Amazon S3 error message\. For more information, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\.  |  February 17, 2011  | 
|  Response Header API Support  |  The GET Object REST API now allows you to change the response headers of the REST GET Object request for each request\.
