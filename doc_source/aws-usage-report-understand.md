**Notes:**

1. If you terminate a transfer before completion, the amount of data that is transferred might exceed the amount of data that your application receives\. This discrepancy can occur because a transfer termination request cannot be executed instantaneously, and some amount of data might be in transit pending execution of the termination request\. This data in transit is billed as data transferred âout\.â

1. When objects that are archived to the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before the minimum storage commitment has passed, which is 90 days for S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval and S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or 180\-days for S3 Glacier Deep Archive, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For objects that are in S3 Standard\-IA or S3 One Zone\-IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For small objects \(smaller than 128 KB\) that are in S3 Standard\-IA or S3 One Zone\-IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. There is no minimum billable object size for objects in the S3 Intelligent\-Tiering storage class\. Objects that are smaller than 128 KB are not monitored or eligible for auto\-tiering\. Smaller objects are always stored in the S3 Intelligent\-Tiering Frequent Access tier\.

1. When you initiate an âInitiateMultipartUpload,â âUploadPart,â or âCopyPartâ request to either the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, requests are billed at S3 Standard request rates until you complete the multipart upload\. Once the upload completes, the single âCompleteMultipartUploadâ request is billed at the PUT rate for the destination S3 Glacier storage\. In\-progress multipart parts for a PUT to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class are billed as S3 Glacier Staging Storage at S3 Standard storage rates until the upload completes\. Similarly, in\-progress multipart parts for a PUT to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class are billed as S3 Glacier Deep Archive Staging Storage at S3 Standard storage rates until the upload completes\.

## Tracking Operations in Your Usage Reports<a name="aws-usage-report-understand-operations"></a>

Operations describe the action taken on your AWS object or bucket by the specified usage type\. Operations are indicated by self\-explanatory codes, such as `PutObject` or `ListBucket`\. To see which actions on your bucket generated a specific type of usage, use these codes\. When you create a usage report, you can choose to include **All Operations**, or a specific operation, for example, `GetObject`, to report on\.
