# Viewing storage usage and activity metrics with Amazon S3 Storage Lens<a name="storage_lens_view_metrics"></a>

By default, all dashboards are configured with **free metrics**, which include [usage metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_basics_metrics_recommendations.html#storage_lens_basics_metrics_types) aggregated down to the bucket level with a 14\-day data retention\. This means that you can see all the usage metrics that S3 Storage Lens aggregates, and your data will be available 14 days from the day it was aggregated\. 

**Advanced metrics and recommendations** include usage metrics with prefix\-level aggregation, activity metrics aggregated by bucket, and contextual recommendations \(available only in the dashboard\)\. [Activity metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_basics_metrics_recommendations.html#storage_lens_basics_metrics_types) have a 15\-month data retention policy\. There are additional charges for using S3 Storage Lens with advanced metrics\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing)\.
