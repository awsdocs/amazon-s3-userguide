# Using Amazon S3 access logs to identify requests<a name="using-s3-access-logs-to-identify-requests"></a>

You can identify Amazon S3 requests using Amazon S3 access logs\. 

**Note**  
We recommend that you use AWS CloudTrail data events instead of Amazon S3 access logs\. CloudTrail data events are easier to set up and contain more information\. For more information, see [Identifying Amazon S3 requests using CloudTrail](cloudtrail-request-identification.md)\.
Depending on how many access requests you get, it might require more resources or time to analyze your logs\.

## Querying access logs for requests using Amazon Athena<a name="querying-s3-access-logs-for-requests"></a>

You can identify Amazon S3 requests with Amazon S3 access logs using Amazon Athena\. 

Amazon S3 stores server access logs as objects in an S3 bucket\. It is often easier to use a tool that can analyze the logs in Amazon S3\. Athena supports analysis of S3 objects and can be used to query Amazon S3 access logs\.

**Example**  
The following example shows how you can query Amazon S3 server access logs in Amazon Athena\.   
To specify an Amazon S3 location in an Athena query, you need to format the *target* bucket name and *target* prefix where your logs are delivered as an S3 URI, as follows: `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1-logs/prefix/` 

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home)\.

1. In the Query Editor, run a command similar to the following\.

   ```
   create database s3_access_logs_db
   ```
**Note**  
It's a best practice to create the database in the same AWS Region as your S3 bucket\. 

1. In the Query Editor, run a command similar to the following to create a table schema in the database that you created in step 2\. The `STRING` and `BIGINT` data type values are the access log properties\. You can query these properties in Athena\. For `LOCATION`, enter the S3 bucket and prefix path as noted earlier\.

   ```
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs`(
     `bucketowner` STRING, 
     `bucket_name` STRING, 
     `requestdatetime` STRING, 
     `remoteip` STRING, 
     `requester` STRING, 
     `requestid` STRING, 
     `operation` STRING, 
     `key` STRING, 
     `request_uri` STRING, 
     `httpstatus` STRING, 
     `errorcode` STRING, 
     `bytessent` BIGINT, 
     `objectsize` BIGINT, 
     `totaltime` STRING, 
     `turnaroundtime` STRING, 
     `referrer` STRING, 
     `useragent` STRING, 
     `versionid` STRING, 
     `hostid` STRING, 
     `sigv` STRING, 
     `ciphersuite` STRING, 
     `authtype` STRING, 
     `endpoint` STRING, 
     `tlsversion` STRING,
     `accesspointarn` STRING,
     `aclrequired` STRING)
   ROW FORMAT SERDE 
     'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe' 
   WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( 
     'input.regex'='([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) \\[(.*?)\\] ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) (\"[^\"]*\"|-) (-|[0-9]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) (\"[^\"]*\"|-) ([^ ]*)(?: ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*))?.*$') 
   STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 
     'org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat' 
   OUTPUTFORMAT 
     'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
   LOCATION
     's3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1-logs/prefix/'
   ```

1. In the navigation pane, under **Database**, choose your database\.

1. Under **Tables**, choose **Preview table** next to your table name\.

   In the **Results** pane, you should see data from the server access logs, such as `bucketowner`, `bucket`, `requestdatetime`, and so on\. This means that you successfully created the Athena table\. You can now query the Amazon S3 server access logs\.

**Example — Show who deleted an object and when \(timestamp, IP address, and IAM user\)**  

```
SELECT requestdatetime, remoteip, requester, key 
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs 
WHERE key = 'images/picture.jpg' AND operation like '%DELETE%';
```

**Example — Show all operations that were performed by an IAM user**  

```
SELECT * 
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs 
WHERE requester='arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/user_name';
```

**Example — Show all operations that were performed on an object in a specific time period**  

```
SELECT *
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE Key='prefix/images/picture.jpg' 
    AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
    BETWEEN parse_datetime('2017-02-18:07:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
    AND parse_datetime('2017-02-18:08:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss');
```

**Example — Show how much data was transferred to a specific IP address in a specific time period**  

```
SELECT coalesce(SUM(bytessent), 0) AS bytessenttotal,
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE remoteip='1.2.3.4'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2022-06-01','yyyy-MM-dd')
AND parse_datetime('2022-07-01','yyyy-MM-dd');
```

**Note**  
To reduce the time that you retain your log, you can create an Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration for your server access logs bucket\. Configure the lifecycle configuration to remove log files periodically\. Doing so reduces the amount of data that Athena analyzes for each query\. For more information, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md)\.

## Identifying Signature Version 2 requests using Amazon S3 access logs<a name="using-s3-access-logs-to-identify-sigv2-requests"></a>

Amazon S3 support for Signature Version 2 will be turned off \(deprecated\)\. After that, Amazon S3 will no longer accept requests that use Signature Version 2, and all requests must use *Signature Version 4* signing\. You can identify Signature Version 2 access requests using Amazon S3 access logs\. 

**Note**  
We recommend that you use AWS CloudTrail data events instead of Amazon S3 access logs\. CloudTrail data events are easier to set up and contain more information\. For more information, see [Identifying Amazon S3 Signature Version 2 requests by using CloudTrail](cloudtrail-request-identification.md#cloudtrail-identification-sigv2-requests)\.

**Example — Show all requesters that are sending Signature Version 2 traffic**  

```
                   SELECT requester, sigv, Count(sigv) as sigcount 
                   FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
                   GROUP BY requester, sigv;
```

## Identifying object access requests using Amazon S3 access logs<a name="using-s3-access-logs-to-identify-objects-access"></a>

You can use queries on Amazon S3 server access logs to identify Amazon S3 object access requests, for operations such as `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, and discover further information about those requests\.

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all `PUT` object requests for Amazon S3 from the server access log\. 

**Example — Show all requesters that are sending `PUT` object requests in a certain period**  

```
SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE operation='REST.PUT.OBJECT' AND
parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z') 
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND 
parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all `GET` object requests for Amazon S3 from the server access log\. 

**Example — Show all requesters that are sending `GET` object requests in a certain period**  

```
SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE operation='REST.GET.OBJECT' AND
parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z') 
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND 
parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all anonymous requests to your S3 buckets from the server access log\. 

**Example — Show all anonymous requesters that are making requests to a bucket during a certain period**  

```
SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE requester IS NULL AND
parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z') 
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND 
parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query shows how to identify all requests to your S3 buckets that required an access control list \(ACL\) for authorization\. You can use this information to migrate those ACL permissions to the appropriate bucket policies and disable ACLs\. After you've created these bucket policies, you can disable ACLs for these buckets\. For more information about disabling ACLs, see [Prerequisites for disabling ACLs](object-ownership-migrating-acls-prerequisites.md)\. 

**Example — Identify all requests that required an ACL for authorization**  

```
SELECT bucket_name, requester, key, operation, aclrequired, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE aclrequired = 'Yes' AND
parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2022-05-10:00:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2022-08-10:00:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

**Note**  
You can modify the date range as needed to suit your needs\.
These query examples might also be useful for security monitoring\. You can review the results for `PutObject` or `GetObject` calls from unexpected or unauthorized IP addresses/requesters and for identifying any anonymous requests to your buckets\.
This query only retrieves information from the time at which logging was enabled\.
